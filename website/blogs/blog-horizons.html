                <h1>What Does Horizons for Youth Do?</h1>
                <p>Horizons for Youth gives young people a safe place to stay when they don’t have one. But they don’t stop there. They also help with meals, education, mental health, job support, and life skills. It’s not just about giving someone a bed. It’s about helping them move forward.</p>
                <p>A lot of youth end up homeless because of serious stuff happening at home. Some are fleeing abuse. Others have been neglected or kicked out. It’s not just “bad luck” — it’s often years of not being supported. That’s where shelters like Horizons come in. They don’t judge. They help.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Youth homelessness is a real issue in cities like Toronto, but it doesn’t always get attention. Not every young person on the street is visible. Some are couch surfing. Some are sleeping in unsafe places just to stay out of the cold.</p>
                <p>And when you're young and on your own, it's hard to figure out school, work, or even where your next meal is coming from.</p>
                <p>Shelters like Horizons for Youth are one of the few lifelines out there. They offer structure, support, and hope.</p>

                <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
                <p>Even if you’re not in a position to donate money, you can still make a difference:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn more about youth homelessness</li>
                    <li>Share info about Horizons for Youth and similar organizations</li>
                    <li>If you can, donate clothes, hygiene items, or food</li>
                    <li>Volunteer your time if the shelter accepts it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The more we talk about these issues, the harder they are to ignore.</p>

                <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>No young person should have to go through life without support. Places like Horizons for Youth are working hard to change that, one person at a time. Let’s do what we can to support them and keep the conversation going.</p>
