                <h1>What is Couch Surfing?</h1>
                <p>Couch surfing is when someone sleeps at different people’s homes (on couches, floors, or spare beds) because they don’t have a home of their own. It’s often thought of as “not that bad” because they’re not on the streets. But here’s the truth:</p>
                <p>Couch surfing is still homelessness.</p>
                <p>Young people who couch surf often move from place to place, staying with friends, relatives, or even strangers. They might not know where they’ll sleep next week—or even tomorrow.</p>

                <h3>Why Do Young People Couch Surf?</h3>
                <p>There are lots of reasons why a young person might end up couch surfing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They had to leave home because it wasn’t safe.</li>
                    <li>Their family can’t afford rent or lost their housing.</li>
                    <li>They aged out of foster care and don’t have support.</li>
                    <li>They came out as LGBTQ+ and were rejected by their family.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many don’t want to be “a burden,” so they move around quietly, trying not to be noticed. That’s why couch surfing youth are sometimes called the hidden homeless.</p>

                <h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
                <p>Couch surfing might seem better than sleeping outside but it’s still really tough. It can mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No privacy or personal space</li>
                    <li>Missing school or work because of moving around</li>
                    <li>Feeling unsafe or uncomfortable in someone else’s home</li>
                    <li>Struggling with stress, anxiety, or depression</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It’s hard to focus on your future when you don’t even know where you’ll sleep.</p>

                <h3>What Can We Do?</h3>
                <p>Here are a few ways we can help young people who are couch surfing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t judge: If someone opens up to you, listen and support them.</li>
                    <li>Support local shelters and services: They provide safe places and resources.</li>
                    <li>Raise awareness: Many people don’t realize couch surfing is a form of homelessness.</li>
                    <li>Be kind and inclusive: Sometimes just knowing someone cares can make a big difference.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Everyone Deserves Stability</h3>
                <p>Couch surfing might sound temporary, but for many young people, it’s a long and uncertain journey. No one should have to live without stability, safety, or support.</p>
                <p>Let’s look out for each other and make sure no one is left without support, especially those simply trying to find a safe place to sleep.</p>
