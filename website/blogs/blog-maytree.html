                <h1>What Does Maytree Do?</h1>
                <p>Maytree works on improving public policy so that all people in Canada can live with dignity and stability. That means they help build better systems for things like affordable housing, fair wages, and social support.</p>
                <p>They also support local leaders and organizations so they can speak up and influence decisions in their own communities. Their research and reports help explain complex issues in simple ways, which is helpful for anyone who wants to learn or get involved.</p>
                <p>Maytree is about justice and fairness, not just charity.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Many people think poverty is caused by bad personal choices, but that is not true. Poverty happens when systems fail. This includes when housing is too expensive, when jobs do not pay enough to live on, or when someone cannot access the help they need.</p>
                <p>Maytree works to fix those systems. They focus on root causes, not just symptoms.</p>
                <p>When policies improve, more people can afford to live, work, and take care of their families. That benefits all of us.</p>

                <h3>How You Can Support</h3>
                <p>Even though Maytree works at the policy level, there are still ways you can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read and share their reports and articles. They are free and easy to understand.</li>
                    <li>Learn more about how poverty works in Canada.</li>
                    <li>Support groups in your community that are working for housing, fair pay, and human rights.</li>
                    <li>Vote in local and national elections. Policies change when people speak up.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>Maytree is doing work that often happens behind the scenes, but it has a big impact. They are helping shape a Canada where fewer people fall through the cracks, and where everyone has a fair chance.</p>
                <p>Their message is simple. Poverty is not just a problem to manage. It is a problem we can solve. And to do that, we need better systems and stronger voices.</p>
