                <h1>What is Youth Homelessness?</h1>
                <p>Youth homelessness happens when young people, usually between the ages of 12 and 24, don’t have a safe place to live. This could mean sleeping on the streets, in shelters, or even couch surfing at a friend’s place because they have nowhere else to go.</p>
                <p>Imagine trying to go to school, work a job, or plan your future without knowing where you'll sleep tonight. That’s the reality for many young people.</p>

                <h3>Why Does It Happen?</h3>
                <p>There isn’t just one reason. Here are a few common ones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Family problems:</strong> Some young people leave home because of abuse, neglect, or big fights at home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> When families can’t afford housing, young people might end up on their own.</li>
                    <li><strong>LGBTQ+ rejection:</strong> Some young people are kicked out because of who they are or who they love.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aging out of foster care:</strong> When teens in foster care turn 18, they often don’t have anywhere to go.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Happens to Homeless Youth?</h3>
                <p>Without a stable home, life gets really hard. Homeless youth are more likely to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Miss school or drop out</li>
                    <li>Struggle with mental health</li>
                    <li>Face violence and abuse on the streets</li>
                    <li>Get sick more often</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But here’s the thing: they’re just like anyone else. They have dreams, talents, and hopes for the future. They just need a little help.</p>

                <h3>How Can We Help?</h3>
                <p>You don’t have to be rich or famous to make a difference. Here’s what you can do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learn more:</strong> The more we know, the more we can help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speak up:</strong> Talk about it with your friends and family. Awareness matters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support local shelters:</strong> Donate clothes, food, or your time if you can.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be kind:</strong> A smile or a friendly word can mean a lot to someone going through a tough time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Everyone Deserves a Safe Place</h3>
                <p>Nobody should have to face the world alone, especially not young people. If we work together, we can build a world where every young person has a safe place to sleep, grow, and dream.</p>
