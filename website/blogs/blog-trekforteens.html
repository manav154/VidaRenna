                <h1>What is Trek for Teens?</h1>
                <p>Trek for Teens is a youth-led organization that raises awareness and funds for homeless youth. We work with local shelters and support services in cities across Canada. Through events like walks, concerts, and school campaigns, we aim to shine a light on a problem that often stays hidden.</p>
                <p>Because youth homelessness is real. And it matters.</p>

                <h3>Why Are So Many Young People Homeless?</h3>
                <p>There are many reasons why young people end up without a safe place to live. Some leave home because of abuse, neglect, or conflict. Others are kicked out for being LGBTQ plus. Some age out of foster care and have nowhere to go.</p>
                <p>Whatever the reason, no one should have to face life alone.</p>
                <p>Youth who are homeless often have to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Miss school</li>
                    <li>Go without food</li>
                    <li>Sleep in unsafe places</li>
                    <li>Deal with stress and mental health struggles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They are not lazy or broken. They are strong, brave, and doing their best to survive.</p>

                <h3>How Does Trek for Teens Help?</h3>
                <p>Trek for Teens raises money for shelters and services that give youth what they need most: safety, support, and hope. They also work hard to educate others. When people learn about youth homelessness, they start to care. And when they care, they take action.</p>
                <p>Whether it is through walking in our events, donating, or simply talking about it, everyone can do something.</p>

                <h3>How Can You Get Involved?</h3>
                <p>Here are a few ways you can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Join a Trek for Teens walk in your city</li>
                    <li>Start a fundraiser at your school or in your community</li>
                    <li>Follow and share our message on social media</li>
                    <li>Learn more and talk about youth homelessness with your friends and family</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Small steps can lead to big change.</p>

                <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>When we walk together, we are showing that youth homelessness matters and that we care. Every step helps raise awareness and support for young people who need a safe place to live.</p>
